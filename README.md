# About Me
Hey there! I'm Aaron, third year CS major at Ohio University. I have a school account, if you wanna see what I've done over there check out @aamckennapro. Otherwise, you're stuck here!

## My Goals
My goal with this separate account is to pretty much do side projects. Be it websites, apps, programs on the cloud, algorithms, automata theory, compiler theory, computation theory, general software development, data science, you'll see a lot of variety here!

## My Languages
I primarily write in C++, C#, Go, and Rust. I'm looking to pick up languages for the express purpose of *if* they're best at doing what I want to do.

## My Projects
This is where I'll place a big repo that'll take you directly to my projects. I'm trying to do everything from start to finish, one at a time, within a time limit (generally 30 days), so for a while you won't see a lot there.
