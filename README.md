Hello, my name is Aaron McKenna, CS major at Ohio University. This is my account primarily for side projects, or just personal projects. My school account is @aamckennapro.
What I want to do with this account is simply start and finish projects, one idea at a time. I'd like to organize these projects under one giant repository, which of course
links to the other, smaller repositories.
That repo will be here, underlined somewhere as a hyperlink. 
My projects will range from mundane to exciting, incredibly easy to incredibly hard. My goal is to tackle *every* single branch or discipline in the world of Computer Science. 
I've also been reading a ton of books, so I'll likely have a book referenced with each project, mayhaps a certain excerpt from said book.
